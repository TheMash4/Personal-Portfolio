            <p>My name is <strong>Samuel Macharia</strong> and this is my personal <em>Portfolio</em>.<br>
            For those who are not familiar with what a portfolio is it is a brief description of who i am , what i love doing and how you can contact me.
            I recently started schooling at <strong>Moringa</strong> and im hoping to gain more knowledge when it comes to coding. 
            I am still yet to finish university but it will take sometime before that happens but if you would want to read more about that go to the <strong>
            <a href="about.html">About</a></strong> to find out more plus if you would like to know where to contact me go to the <strong><a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page
